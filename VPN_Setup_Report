## 🧰 Tools Used

* **VPN Client:** ProtonVPN (Free Tier)
* **Verification Tools:**

  * [WhatIsMyIPAddress](https://whatismyipaddress.com)
  * [Google Internet Speed Test](https://www.google.com/search?q=speedtest)
* **System Used:** Windows 11

## ⚙️ Steps Performed

1️⃣ **Created an account** on [ProtonVPN](https://protonvpn.com/signup) using the Free Tier.
2️⃣ **Installed** the ProtonVPN Windows client.
3️⃣ **Connected** to a VPN server located in **Tokyo (Japan)** via Quick Connect.
4️⃣ **Verified IP change** using [WhatIsMyIPAddress](https://whatismyipaddress.com).
5️⃣ **Measured internet speed** before and after enabling VPN.

## 🌐 IP and Speed Verification

| Condition   | Server Location | Download (Mbps) | Upload (Mbps)  | Latency |
| ----------- | --------------- | --------------- | -------------- | ------- |
| Without VPN | New Delhi       | **130.8 Mbps**  | **127.5 Mbps** | 50 ms   |
| With VPN    | Tokyo           | **74.8 Mbps**   | **4.78 Mbps**  | 2 ms    |

✅ **Result:** VPN successfully changed IP location and encrypted traffic, though performance dropped slightly.

## 🔐 VPN Encryption and Privacy Features

VPNs use a combination of **encryption algorithms, tunneling protocols, and authentication mechanisms** to ensure data confidentiality and integrity.

### 1️⃣ Encryption

* **AES-256 Encryption:** Most VPNs, including ProtonVPN, use Advanced Encryption Standard (AES-256 bit) — a military-grade cipher that’s nearly impossible to brute-force.
* **Key Exchange (RSA-4096):** Secures session keys used for encryption.
* **HMAC Authentication:** Ensures data packets aren’t modified during transmission.

### 2️⃣ Tunneling Protocols

VPNs use secure channels to transmit data:

* **OpenVPN:** Reliable and open-source; balances speed and security.
* **WireGuard:** Lightweight and faster, uses modern cryptographic primitives.
* **IKEv2/IPSec:** Known for stability, especially during mobile switching (Wi-Fi ↔ mobile data).

### 3️⃣ Privacy Protections

* **IP Masking:** Replaces your real IP with the VPN server’s IP, hiding your identity and location.
* **No-Logs Policy:** Trusted VPNs (like ProtonVPN) claim not to store user activity or connection data.
* **DNS and IPv6 Leak Protection:** Prevents accidental exposure of real DNS requests or IP addresses.
* **Kill Switch:** Automatically disconnects internet access if the VPN connection drops — ensuring no unprotected data leaks.

## 🧩 Summary — VPN Benefits and Limitations

### ✅ **Benefits**

1. **Data Encryption:** All transmitted information is encrypted, preventing snooping by ISPs or attackers.
2. **IP Masking:** Protects user identity by hiding the real location and IP.
3. **Safe Public Wi-Fi:** Prevents data theft on unsecured networks like airports or cafes.
4. **Geo-Unblocking:** Allows access to restricted websites or region-locked content.
5. **Improved Privacy:** Shields browsing activities from government or corporate tracking.

### ⚠️ **Limitations**

1. **Reduced Speed:** Encryption and routing through remote servers can slow down connections.
2. **Limited Free Servers:** Free VPN plans often restrict available servers and speed.
3. **Potential Logging:** Some providers might store metadata, reducing anonymity.
4. **Not Full Anonymity:** VPN hides IPs but doesn’t make you completely anonymous (especially if logged into accounts).
5. **Blocked by Some Websites:** Streaming or corporate services may block known VPN IPs.

## 🧾 Overall Summary

This experiment demonstrated that VPNs are powerful privacy tools that encrypt internet traffic, conceal IP addresses, and protect user data from interception. ProtonVPN successfully established a secure tunnel between the client and Tokyo server, changing the IP address and encrypting all communication. The minor reduction in network speed was an expected trade-off for enhanced privacy and security.

Overall, VPNs are highly effective for **data protection and private browsing**, though users should understand their **technical limits** and choose trusted providers for maximum safety.
